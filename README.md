# YouTube-Clone

A  YouTube clone I created for the sake of practicing React and Redux. It features design 
patterns recommended by the documentation. Some of the tools used include: <br />

* Hooks (and custom hooks)
* React Router
* @material-ui/core
* firebase
* axios
* react-lazyload
* react-router-dom
* numeral

It is a work in progress, and my first real project with React. Any tips on how to better write the  18 code, manage the folder structure, etc would be really appreciated. <br />

The features of this project: <br />

* Create an authentication flow by useing firebase . 
* create six pages (Home , Watch Video , Channel , Watch Later , Subscribes , Search  ) .
* you could make Subscribes to channel  , it stores at loacal storage .  
* you could search for videos at search page . 
* any video you watched save at watch later .  

## note please put the youtube api key to make the app work .
